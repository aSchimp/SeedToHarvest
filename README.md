Seed To Harvest
=============

A cross-platform mobile app for crop records - designed with the organic farmer in mind.

Cross-platform capabilities
---------------
Seed to Harvest is built on the Rhodes Framework (part of the RhoMobile Suite), which allows it to be used on multiple mobile platforms with only minor changes to the code. The current version is for iOS devices. More information about the RhoMobile Suite can be found [here](http://www.motorolasolutions.com/US-EN/Business+Product+and+Services/Software+and+Applications/RhoMobile+Suite). The GitHub repository for the Rhodes Framework can be found [here](https://github.com/rhomobile/rhodes). Note that Seed to Harvest uses an older version of the framework.

Disclaimer
---------------
I haven't touched this code since the beginning of 2012, so it may or may not run properly on newer mobile devices.
